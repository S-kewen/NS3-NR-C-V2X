 * Notes:
 * 1. The state 'Start' is not included in #MacState and only used
 *    for illustration purpose.
 * 2. The Unassociated state is a transient state before STA starts the
 *    scanning procedure which moves it into the Scanning state.
 * 3. In Scanning, STA is gathering beacon or probe response frames from APs,
 *    resulted in a list of candidate AP. After the timeout, it then tries to
 *    associate to the best AP, which is indicated by the Association Manager.
 *    STA will restart the scanning procedure if SetActiveProbing() called.
 * 4. In the case when AP responded to STA's association request with a
 *    refusal, STA will try to associate to the next best AP until the list
 *    of candidate AP is exhausted which sends STA to Refused state.
 *    - Note that this behavior is not currently tested since ns-3 does not
  *     implement association refusal at present.
 * 5. The transition from Wait Association Response to Unassociated
 *    occurs if an association request fails without explicit
 *    refusal (i.e., the AP fails to respond).
 * 6. The transition from Associated to Wait Association Response
 *    occurs when STA's PHY capabilities changed. In this state, STA
 *    tries to reassociate with the previously associated AP.
 * 7. The transition from Associated to Unassociated occurs if the number
 *    of missed beacons exceeds the threshold.
